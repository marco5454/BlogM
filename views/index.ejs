      <p>
        Migrant workers across Asia face myriad challenges, starting with the
        recruitment process. The vast majority are recruited via a
        non-transparent regime of employment agencies, resulting in the
        exploitation of tens of thousands of workers every year. Fragmented
        recruitment schemes often lead to excessive fees, working conditions
        akin to forced labour, ineffective complaint and grievance procedures,
        restrictions on freedom of movement, isolation and limited access to
        justice.
